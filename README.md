# Phase Field Simulations of Ferroelectrics

## Overview

This repository contains Python codes for phase field simulations of ferroelectrics. The phase field method is employed to model the evolution of polarization domains in ferroelectric materials. The Fourier spectral method has been used to solve the constitutive and balance equations. For more details, refer to https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2022.111928.
